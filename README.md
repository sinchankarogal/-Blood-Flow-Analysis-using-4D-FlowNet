# 4D FlowNet: A Machine Learning Approach for 4D Flow MRI Data Analysis

## Overview
The 4D FlowNet project aims to analyze and process 4D Flow MRI data efficiently using machine learning techniques. It focuses on providing a novel approach to handle low-resolution patches as input and extract meaningful flow characteristics for downstream tasks such as fluid dynamics analysis, visualization, and diagnosis.

## Features
- **Low-Resolution Input Handling:** Efficiently processes low-resolution MRI patches.
- **4D Flow Analysis:** Extracts spatiotemporal flow information from 4D Flow MRI data.
- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Leverages advanced neural networks for feature extraction and prediction.
- **Generalization:** Adaptable for various 4D Flow MRI datasets and downstream applications.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/4D-FlowNet.git
   cd 4D-FlowNet
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run initial setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

## Dataset
### Data Description
The project uses 4D Flow MRI datasets that include spatial and temporal flow information.

### Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include:
- Normalization
- Gaussian Blur application
- Fourier Transform for noise reduction

### Usage
Place your dataset in the `data/` directory with the following structure:
```
data/
  |-- raw/
  |-- processed/
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the following command to start training:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Testing the Model
To evaluate the trained model, use:
```bash
python test.py --model-path saved_models/model.pth
```

### Visualization
Generate visualizations for flow analysis using:
```bash
python visualize.py --input data/processed/sample.nii
```

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy and generalization in capturing flow dynamics. Detailed evaluation metrics are available in the `results/` directory.
